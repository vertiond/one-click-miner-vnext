The Verthash One-Click Miner mines [Vertcoin](https://vertcoin.org) and is functionally the same as [upstream](https://github.com/vertcoin-project/one-click-miner-vnext) utilizing a new data directory, `verthash-ocm`.  This is essentially a fancy wrapper for [VerthashMiner](https://github.com/CryptoGraphics/VerthashMiner) which is also open source.

This software is available for Windows and Linux.
